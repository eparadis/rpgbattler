## Notes, Bugs, and Caveats ##

### Gameplay ###
 - Game balance is totally whack
 - This started out as a tech-demo/learning experience and grew into something of an actual game, but it is still not really a full game.

### Code ###
 - The code needs refactoring because it grew out of a tech demo
 - I discovered and learned many new programming patterns while writing this game, and over-used some because of it.

### Art ###
 - The art isn't very good

### Bugs ###
 - There are no sound volume controls
 - There exists code for boss and minion fights, but they never show up.
